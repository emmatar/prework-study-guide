# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Entering an entirely new field of education can not only be intimidating, but it can cause someone to lose track of all the new information they learn along the way. The Prework Study Guide WebPage 
was developed to help create a foundation where students can revisit key class lessons/information and ideas they find important from the KU Bootcamp Course. So, that when things get chaotic, you can always fall back on the Prework Study Guide Webpage!

## Feedback

Developing this project always started out as we described above, a way for students to review the information they think is important throughout this bootcamp course, but through the eyes of a new student, it has become much more. As I find myself jotting new notes, I begin to correlate new concepts with previous foundations. This Webpage has become a motivity in fascination towards learning new material and developing an order to the knowledge obtained.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide Webpage is layed out with four divided topics: HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. Each section has organized notes regarding to that topic for easy studying. A feature within the Webpage, a user can open the DevTools console and the Javascript will show the topics learned from the prework, and a new topic for us to learn.
